# RvtVa3c

A Revit custom exporter add-in generating JSON output for the [vA3C](http://va3c.github.io) [three.js](http://threejs.org) AEC viewer.


## Setup, Compilation and Installation

RvtVa3c is a Revit add-in implementing an external application and an external command.

It is installed in the standard manner, i.e., by copying two files to the standard Revit Add-Ins folder:

- The .NET assembly DLL `RvtVa3c.dll`
- The add-in manifest `RvtVa3c.addin`

In order to generate the DLL, you download and compile the Visual Studio solution:

- Download or clone the [RvtVa3c GitHub repository](https://github.com/va3c/RvtVa3c).
- Open the solution file RvtVa3c.sln in Visual Studio; to build it:
- Add references to the Revit API assembly files `RevitAPI.dll` and `RevitAPIUI.dll`, located in your Revit installation directory.
- If you wish to debug, set up the path to the Revit executable in the Debug tab, Start External Program; change the path to your system installation, e.g., `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit Architecture 2017\Revit.exe`.
- Build and optionally debug into Revit.exe.

This will open the Revit installation and install the plugin.

You can then either start up Revit.exe manually or via the Visual Studio debugger.

In Revit, the RvtVa3c add-in external command can be launched from the Revit Add-Ins tab, which causes it to export your Revit model to a JSON file.
